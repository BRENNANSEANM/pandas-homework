Homework Stock Research/Analysis

## A Whale of a Portfolio - an excersixe in data cleaing and stock analysis

In the attached JupyterLab file I went onto perform the following tasks:

* Data Cleaning - took in the five major portfolios along with the SP500 and joined them into one data frame.
    * This included the organization of data and removing null valriables

* Perform Quantitative Analysis - to best determine risk and performance of the portfolios against the SP500 index.
    * Calulated Daily and Cumulative Returns of all the portfolios

* Risk Analaysis - both visually via a box plot and also seeing which portfolios carried more risk than the SP500
    * Reviewed and presented corrlelation against each portfolio
    * Analyized Beta as a risk measure
    * Calculated the Sharp Returns so see if we could expect a portfolio to out perfom the index.

* Visualized cumulative performance based on comparitive plot measuring the performance of $10,000 in each portfolio and determined Algo 1 was a top perfomer.

## Custum Portfolio - chose 3 to 5 stocks and create a portfolio to out perform the SP500

* Data Gathering - leveraged yfinance to pull stock information for Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft and Google.

* Portfolio Analyiss - through a similar process described above proved that my portfolio best the SP500 along with the other portfolios in this analyis
    * Nothing comes with out risk, and my portfolio was tech heavy, not diversified and did carry a high level or risk and volatility.
